    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>After a slew of collaborative releases with adidas and Nike, DC-based sneaker boutique A Ma Maniére teamed up with Jordan Brand to release a women’s exclusive Jordan 3 with the Air Jordan 3 A Ma Maniére (W). The release aligns with their short film Raised By Women, an ode to the strides and accomplishments of everyday women in urban communities. The Air Jordan 3 A Ma Maniére arrives featuring a white tumbled leather upper with Medium Grey suede on the toe wrap, eyestay, heel wrap, and ankle. Each panel of leather on the upper has a raw trim, revealing a natural, tan edge. To provide a vintage aesthetic, the eyelets, heel tab, and lower portion of the midsole are yellowed. From there, the tongue on the left sneaker features an embroidered A Ma Maniére logo, while the right features a Jumpman logo. Quilted satin lining on the interior of the shoe adds an element of luxury. A white, Violet Ore, and Medium Grey sole with a classic Air unit in the heel completes this retro look. </p>
